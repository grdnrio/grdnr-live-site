      <title>Comments on Cloud Pro - Databases in the cloud</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made some comments about the challenges that arise when hosting databases, in particular production databases, in a cloud environment. It was interesting to consider where the pain points would be with PaaS and IaaS, and the benefits and draw backs of each option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When executing your organisation’s database strategy it is important to consider whether this will be an IaaS or PaaS implementation. A decision between IaaS and PaaS will generally depend on the type of database and the expertise in the business, according to Joe Gardiner, product head at cloud hosting firm CatN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“IaaS is becoming more and more commoditised so it can appear an inexpensive option. However, the expertise required to configure a scalable and resilient environment on IaaS for a production database are not to be underestimated and are rarely cheap,” says Gardiner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some points I made about the importance of good code hosted on the cloud were published on Cloud Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area that Joe Gardiner, head of product at cloud hosting firm 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://catn.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Catn&lt;/a&gt;, believes is overlooked is the quality of code used in cloud applications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let’s face it – good code is better than poor code – especially if that poor code means you are using much more public cloud capacity than you actually need,” he says. “A good project manager should have regular “sanity check” milestones that should highlight whether there is a way to optimise the resource requirements of an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
