      <description>&lt;p&gt;I deliver many presentations over various teleconferencing software from my Mac Book Pro. If you like to use speaker notes in presenter view in Powerpoint then this poses a problem. You have a single screen so when sharing it how can you also view notes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could aways just add second monitor and share the primary presentation screen, but what if you&amp;rsquo;re on the move or in a call booth? There is a workaround, but it requires an iOS device with iOS 7.0+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using the 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.duetdisplay.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Duest Display&lt;/a&gt;  app you can turn your iOS device into a secondary screen. This is a great app (costing Â£7.99) that provides you with numerous options for configuring the secondary iOS screen. It&amp;rsquo;s works over WiFi, but can be terribly slow, so just hook your device up to your laptop with the provided cable. Make sure it&amp;rsquo;s the official Apple one- I had issues with a third party cable. Duet also works on Windows ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;re all setup with Duet it&amp;rsquo;s just a case of setting the iOS device (or whichever you prefer) as your secondary screen so that presenter view loads. When you&amp;rsquo;re on a video call share the presentation screen and you will be able to view your notes on the mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
